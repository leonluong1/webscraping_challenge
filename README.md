# Mars Weather Data Analysis
This project is about examining weather observations from the Curiosity rover including temperature and atmospheric pressure. We have python notebooks that contains starter code for the analysis. We scraped the Mars weather website and put that data into a DataFrame. We analyzed the data to answer meaningful questions.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my Beautiful Soup, Splinter and Pandas knowledge. I used Splinter to automate web browsing and Beautiful Soup to scrape the data off the websites. I created a Python notebook and stored the data into a DataFrame. I organized the DataFrame using different queries and plotted the charts. Then, I was able to answer questions using the data and visualizations. Finally, I exported the DataFrame into a csv file.

The file types in this repository are csv files and an ipynb file.
